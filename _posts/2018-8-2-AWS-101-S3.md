Simple Storage Service - S3
S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, high-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is for files not for operating systems and DB.

S3 is a safe place to store your files.
It is Object-based storage.
The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities. 

### Notes
#### S3 The basics

- S3 is Object-based - i.e. allows you to upload files,
- files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
- there is unlimited storage (no need to predict)
- files are store in buckets (similar to a folder)
- S3 is a universal name space. That is, names must be unique globally. Similar to DNS or Internet address. 
- when you upload a file to S3 you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful (only CLI or API)
- built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform. Amount of time when service is available. 
- Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability,
- Amazon guarantees 99.9(9)% durability for S3. Really safe place to store your data. (11 x 9s)
- Tiered Storage Available,
- Life-cycle Management
- Versioning,
- Encryption,
- Secure your data - Access control list and policies. 

#### Data Consistency Model for S3

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects (first time, as soon as you add object the file is available to read)
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES can take some time to propagate( **not going to be immediate**)

#### S3 is a simple Key-value Store

S3 is **Object based**. Object consist of the following:
- Key - name of the object, filename,
- Value - data, sequence o bytes, 
- Version ID ( important for versioning), allows to rollback or so,
- matadata, you can add your own matadata,
- sub-resources - bucket-specific configurations - bucket policies, access control lists, 
Cross Origin Resources Sharing (CROS), Transfer Acceleration. 

#### S3 - Storage Tiers/Classes

-S3 : 99.99% availability, 99,9 (9) durability - stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently, 

- S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed) For data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee. 

- S3 - One Zone IA: Same as IA however data is stored in a single AZ only, still 99,9(9) durability, but only 99,5% availability. Cost is 20% less than S3 -IA

- Reduced Redundancy Storage - designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99,99% availability of objects over a given year. used for data that can be recreated if lost e.g. thumbnails. Starting to disappear from AWS documentation but may still feature in exam)

- Glacier - very cheap, but used for archival only. Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and it takes 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier. Suitable for historical files. 

#### S3 - Charges

- Storage per GB, 
- request (Get, Put, Copy)
- storage management pricing - inventory , analytics, and Object tags
- data management pricing - data transferred out of S3 (is free to transfer to S3 )
- transfer acceleration - use of CloudFront to optimize transfers,
