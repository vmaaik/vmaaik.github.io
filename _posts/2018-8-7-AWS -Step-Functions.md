Step Functions allows you to visualize and test your server-less applications. Step functions provides a graphical console to arrange and visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. This makes it simple to build and run multi-step applications. Step functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retrieves when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so when things go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly.
