Relational Database

### Notes
#### Relational Database Types which can be provisioned within AWS:

- Sql Server, 
- Oracle, 
- MySql, 
- PostgreSql, 
- Amazon Aurora (full compatible with MySql), 
- Maria DB

#### What is data Warehousing?

Used for business intelligence. Tools like Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server Reporting Services, Oracle Hypervison, SAP NetWeaver. 
Used to pull in very large and complex data sets. Usually used by management to do queries on data(such as current performance vs targets, etc.) 

#### OLTP(Simple) vs OLAP(Complex)

Online Transaction Processing(OLTP) differs from (OLAP) Online Analytics Processing in terms of the types of queries you will run. 

*OLTP Example:*
Online store - Order number 1232411 
Pulls up a row of data such as Name, Date, Address to Delivery to, Delivery Status etc. Simple transaction like INSERT this data INTO this table. RELATIONAL DB is OLTP

*OLAP Example:*
Net Profit for EMEA and Pacific for the Digital Radio Product. Pulls in large numbers of records.
SUM of Radios Sold in EMEA
SUM of Radios Sold in Pacific
Unit Costs of Radio in each region
Sales price - unit costs

RedShift - OLAP (Business intelligence and big data)
Data Warehousing databases use different type of architecture both from a database perspective and infrastructure layer. 

#### What is Elastic Cache?

ElasticCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. 

ElasticCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
- memcached,
- redis.

*Exam tip - architecture change which makes DB run faster - ElasticCache*
Elastic cache is a great way of caching frequently accessed information and so that when users wants to access them they do not need to do pull them from DB.

### RDS Lab - Connecting EC2 instance to RDS instance MySql DB
EC2 instance is in different security group than RDS

1. Create RDS instance
2. Use rds.sh during creating EC2 instance to communicate with DB.
3. Edit connect.php file on drive
4. Connect to EC2 IP/connect.php in browser

[Scripts](https://github.com/vmaaik/aws-demo/tree/master/scripts)

Exam tip - Potential problem:

When we created RDS instance we created a security groups inside RDS instance. This is separate security group than our EC2 instance is in. Now we have two different pieces of AWS cloud and two different security groups and they are not able to talk to each other. The solution is to allow the communication from one security group to another. 

In order to do that edit inbound rules on RDS adding new rule allowing MySql/Aurora connection from any instance in security group where our EC2 is. In this case myDMZ.
Open port 3306.
